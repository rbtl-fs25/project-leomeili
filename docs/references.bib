The recycling of Electric or electronic waste (E-waste) products could allow the diminishing use of virgin resources in manufacturing and, consequently, it could contribute in reducing the environmental pollution. Given that EU is trying, since the last two decades, to develop a circular economy based on the exploitation of resources recovered by wastes, a comprehensive framework supporting the decision-making process of multi-WEEE recycling centres will be analysed in this paper. An economic assessment will define the potential revenues coming from the recovery of 14 e-products (e.g. LCD notebooks, LED notebooks, CRT TVs, LCD TVs, LED TVs, CRT monitors, LCD monitors, LED monitors, cell phones, smart phones, PV panels, HDDs, SSDs and tablets) on the base of current and future disposed volumes in Europe. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis will be used to test the impact of some critical variables (e.g. price of recovered materials, input materials composition, degree of purity obtained by the recycling process, volumes generated, and percentage of collected waste) on specific economic indexes. A discussion of the economic assessment results shows the main challenges in the recycling sector and streamlines some concrete solutions.},

A total of 400 participants were chosen from three public universities in the Klang Valley, and data was collected through questionnaires. The study's findings indicate that the majority of respondents hold a moderately positive attitude toward recycling behavior, possess a low sense of perceived behavioral control, feel a lesser moral obligation toward recycling behavior, view recycling behavior as inconvenient, and exhibit a low level of engagement in recycling behavior. The results also reveal that perceived behavioral control and inconvenience have a significant association with recycling behavior. Furthermore, the regression analysis demonstrates that perceived behavioral control and inconvenience exhibit significant relationships with recycling behavior, with perceived behavioral control exerting the greatest influence on recycling behavior. Both of these factors underline the importance of designing and implementig recycling systems that are accessible, easy to use, and well-explained. Doing so can increase perceived behavioral control and decrease the sense of inconvenience, thereby promoting more consistent and widespread recycling behaviors. Recycling is fundamentally important for environmental sustainability as it conserves natural resources, reduces pollution from waste, decreases the demand for raw materials, and mitigates the negative impacts of disposal, contributing significantly to the preservation of our planet for future generations.},

Design/methodology/approach Using a systematic literature review (SLR), this study methodically collects, codifies, analyses, synthesizes and interprets existing literature and research on Circular Economy. This approach aims for a comprehensive understanding of current global perspectives and practices. Findings The analysis reveals an increasing trend in empirical research focusing on Circular Economy strategies. This paper has identified 22 key strategies linked to public awareness and behaviours towards Circular Economy, noting that purchasing recycled products is the most commonly observed behaviour. The findings highlight the growing importance and complexity of individual roles in the Circular Economy. Research limitations/implications The study underscores the importance of consumer behaviour in advancing Circular Economy practices. This paper observes that despite the growth in Circular Economy research, there is still a notable gap in awareness and behaviour, even in developed countries. This is attributed to a lack of conceptual understanding, educational disparities, resource limitations, a limited grasp of cost--benefit considerations and inadequate government support. The paper also explores regional and sector-specific variations in Circular Economy adoption, with insights from countries such as the USA, China, the UK, Germany, France and Norway. Practical implications This study underscores the importance of consumer behaviour in advancing Circular Economy practices. Despite the growth in Circular Economy research, there is still a notable gap in awareness and behaviour, even in developed countries.

The paper also explores regional and sector-specific variations in Circular Economy adoption, with insights from countries such as the USA, China, the UK, Germany, France and Norway. Social implications This research underscores the impact of demographic and sociocultural factors, including age, education, social norms and attitudes, on Circular Economy engagement. It identifies potential research areas, including examining cultural influences on social and personal norms related to circular behaviours. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the need for a coordinated, cross-sectoral effort to facilitate a sustainable transition to a Circular Economy, addressing barriers and fostering awareness and behaviours conducive to circular practices. Originality/value This study acknowledges challenges affecting the maturity of Circular Economy practices, including a lack of comprehension, educational disparities, resource constraints and limited government support. It also underscores the impact of social and cultural factors on Circular Economy engagement. It suggests promising avenues for future research, providing valuable insights into the state of Circular Economy practices and offering a roadmap for advancing global sustainability initiatives.}

  abstract = {Background: Electronic waste (e-waste) is produced in staggering quantities, estimated globally to be 41.8 million tonnes in 2014. Informal e-waste recycling is a source of much-needed income in many low- to middle-income countries. However, its handling and disposal in underdeveloped countries is often unsafe and leads to contaminated environments. Rudimentary and uncontrolled processing methods often result in substantial harmful chemical exposures among vulnerable populations, including women and children. E-waste hazards have not yet received the attention they deserve in research and public health agendas. Objectives: We provide an overview of the scale and health risks. We review international efforts concerned with environmental hazards, especially affecting children, as a preface to presenting next steps in addressing health issues stemming from the global e-waste problem. Discussion: The e-waste problem has been building for decades. Increased observation of adverse health effects from e-waste sites calls for protecting human health and the environment from e-waste contamination. Even if e-waste exposure intervention and prevention efforts are implemented, legacy contamination will remain, necessitating increased awareness of e-waste as a major environmental health threat. Conclusion: Global, national, and local levels efforts must aim to create safe recycling operations that consider broad security issues for people who rely on e-waste processing for survival. Paramount to these efforts is reducing pregnant women and children's e-waste exposures to mitigate harmful health effects. With human environmental health in mind, novel dismantling methods and remediation technologies and intervention practices are needed to protect communities.

The paper draws upon data gathered from a survey of undergraduate students (n~=~1658) from two Australian universities. Having explored a variety of factors shaping student engagement with digital technology within these university settings, the paper considers how ongoing discussions about digital technology and higher education might better balance enthusiasms for the `state of the art' (i.e. what we know might be achieved through technology-enabled learning) with an acknowledgement of the `state of the actual' (i.e. the realities of technology use within contemporary university contexts).},

Different approximations to the topic have been developed to face the challenges of having a more responsible production of goods and services. These approximations include cleaner production, green design, ecodesign, eco efficiency, design for sustainable behavior, sustainable design, and more recently concepts like circular economies among many more. In all these approaches, the attention has been mainly on the production side while consumption has been tackled indirectly. The majority of laws and ordinances that have motivated the emergence of these approaches have traditionally been oriented to producers. However, an European Union (EU) directive launched in October 2019, called ``right to repair'', could change this paradigm, empowering consumers by giving them more possibilities of repairing their products instead of discarding them. This paper presents a preliminary discussion about the effects this directive might have on how we consume products now and how we will consume them in the future.}

Correlation testing results found statistically significant relationship between attitudes toward purchasing second-hand clothing online as well as through social media platforms and purchase intentions. Respondents indicated that they would buy secondhand clothing online and through social media if the sizing was more accurate and true to present day (r=.695), if the site provided images on how to best style the fashion item (r=.445), and if the second-hand shopping online platform was fast and convenient (r=.645). Additionally, low income female (vs. male) consumers indicated that they buy more second-hand clothing items per month than middle and high income consumer groups.\&lt;/p\&gt;}

Using survey questionnaires, we investigated four different clothing disposal options (resale, donation, reusing and discarding) and examined five motivational factors (environmental, economic, charity and convenience concerns and information unavailability). The influences of attitudes towards the environment and subjective norms of family and friends on clothing disposal behaviours also were examined. Results indicated that resale and donation behaviours were explained by environmental concerns and that reuse and resale behaviours were explained by economic concerns. Charity concerns motivated donation behaviours and convenience motivated discarding behaviours. Further, findings indicated that family subjective norms influenced environmentally motivated resale and donation behaviours.},

  abstract = {The current dropout rate in physics studies in Germany is about 60{\textbackslash}\%, with the majority of dropouts occurring in the first year. Consequently, the physics study entry phase poses a significant challenge for many students. Students' stress perceptions can provide more profound insights into the processes and challenges during that period. In a panel study featuring 67 measuring points involving up to 128 participants at each point, we investigated students' stress perceptions with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), identified underlying sources of stress, and assessed self-estimated workloads across two different cohorts. This examination occurred almost every week during the first semester, and for one cohort also in the second semester, yielding a total of 3,241 PSQ data points and 5,823 stressors. The PSQ data indicate a consistent stress trajectory across all three groups studied that is characterized by significant dynamics between measuring points, spanning from \$M=20.1, SD=15.9\$ to \$M=63.6, SD=13.4\$ on a scale from 0 to 100. Stress levels rise in the first weeks of the lecture, followed by stable, elevated stress levels until the exams and a relaxation phase afterward during the lecture-free time and Christmas vacation. In the first half of the lecture period, students primarily indicated the weekly exercise sheets, the physics lab course, and math courses as stressors; later on, preparation for exams and the exams themselves emerged as the most important stressors. Together with the students' self-estimated workloads that correlate with the PSQ scores, we can create a coherent picture of stress perceptions among first-year physics students, which builds the basis for supportive measures and interventions.},

This article explores drivers and barriers for repair from consumers' and commercial repair actors' viewpoints, in order to understand how the repair rates of household appliances, mobile phones and clothing could be increased. The study is based on a consumer survey of 1196 respondents in Norway, and 15 qualitative interviews with actors in the commercial repair industry working with repairs of household consumer goods. A surprisingly high share of repairs was conducted by consumers themselves. The main barrier is the consistently low price of new products, and often of poor quality, which contributes to low profitability in repair work for businesses and low motivation from consumers. Furthermore, access to competent personnel is a major challenge for the repair industry, a need which is expected to increase in the coming years. Both the industry and consumers agree that better quality of products is a starting point for increased product lifespans, and this will also increase the motivation and the number of profitable repairs. These results have political implications on how to promote longer product lifespans through repair such as increased utilization and knowledge of consumers' complaint and warranty rights.},

  abstract = {Food waste is a serious problem, which undermines the achievement of many sustainable development goals (SDGs), despite their consideration in the agendas of many countries and companies. Notoriously, food waste (FW) causes different kinds of pollution that affect public health and social justice, while contributing to economic losses. This waste phenomenon has causes, drivers, and impacts that require rigorous assessments and effective approaches to mitigate its noxious effects, which are a serious concern for universities. Within these institutions, reducing food waste becomes a circular economy strategy, which is being utilized to assist in promoting sustainable development. However, there is a need for urgent attention to the specific causes of food waste and for consistent actions to reduce it, while boosting awareness in the campus community and triggering a change in students' eating habits. The purpose of this study is to analyze what can be done to reduce the levels of food waste at universities. To achieve this, a review of the theme's state of the art, which is inclusive of an overview of food waste production at universities around the world, is presented. The study employed a qualitative methodology where a comprehensive review of the literature and case studies analyses from selected world regions were considered. The data indicate that a broad variance exists in producing food waste among universities, from 0.12 to 50~kg/capita/day. More factors influence the problem (e.g., gender, age, season, consumer behavior), as well as strategies to solve and prevent it (e.g., composting, recycling, new designs of packages, trayless meals, education), and benefits leading toward food waste reductions from 13 to 50\%. Also, four priority actions were identified to reduce food waste at universities, and these consist of planning and awareness, food preparation and storage, services, and direct waste reuse. With appropriate adaptations, these recommended actions should be deployed as means for reducing food waste at universities around the world, while expanding learning and education in sustainability.},

Although international policies have been formulated to better limit the global transboundary movement of hazardous waste, the existence of illegal trade and ``informal'' recycling has exacerbated the global recycling of e-waste. At present, residents in many low-income areas are still illegally and unscientifically disposing of e-waste to profit from it. The toxic and harmful substances produced affect the global ecological environment through the geochemical cycle. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of the status quo of e-waste recycling globally. E-waste is placed into a framework, grouped by product type, quantity, composition, environmental health risk, and global impact. Management measures, legislative policies, current disposal, and transboundary movement are summarized at international, regional, and national levels, illustrating the status and challenges of e-waste collection and disposal. Techniques such as physical dismantling, component recycling, metal extraction, and re-utilization of non-metallic materials are described, which can have long-term impact on the ecosystem. We advocate that the global sustainable recycling of e-waste be supported by regional cooperation, legislative management, technology development, and eco-friendly design. This study provides a global solution for the recycling of e-waste.},

This paper reports on the results of an international study on sustainable clothing consumption. This paper identifies and analyzes attitudes and behaviors regarding the clothing industry in a sample of 203 individuals. The results suggest a number of trends. Firstly, they show the complexity of purchase habits. The reasons why individuals dispose of their old or not used clothes are manifold, and include objective and subjective factors. Also, the paper illustrates the existence of disparities in respect of clothing use and disposal behavior. Finally, the results suggest that there is a need for more awareness-raising initiatives, in order to make consumers more conscious about the options available and the need for a more sustainable use of clothing.}

To this end, a survey was designed and conducted with a representative sample size of 400 valid responses obtained through telephone interviews. It allowed the identification of the most frequent small EEE in households, and consumer habits as regards replacement, repairs and second-hand purchases. Consumers used small household EEE for an average of 6.25 years; 9.56\% of those interviewed had never repaired broken small household EEE, and only 0.75\% had bought second-hand small household EEE at some time. The analysis of the relationship between consumer attitudes and their socio-economic characteristics using logit models indicated that older consumers and females were more prone to repair small household EEE, while older males with medium family incomes tended to purchase second-hand small household EEE more. Finally, consumers indicated that they considered it is important that the design and labeling of small household EEE included aspects and information about their durability. The obtained results are useful for designing and targeting future awareness campaigns to proper audiences that promote extending the lifetime of EEE by repairing and second-hand purchases. These actions can help to achieve the minimum recovery targets for preparing for the reuse stated within the waste policy framework.},

  abstract = {Background Waste from end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment, known as e-waste, is a rapidly growing global problem. E-waste contains valuable materials that have an economic value when recycled. Unfortunately, the majority of e-waste is recycled in the unregulated informal sector and results in significant risk for toxic exposures to the recyclers, who are frequently women and children. Objectives The aim of this study was to document the extent of the problems associated with inappropriate e-waste recycling practices. Methods This was a narrative review that highlighted where e-waste is generated, where it is recycled, the range of adverse environmental exposures, the range of adverse health consequences, and the policy frameworks that are intended to protect vulnerable populations from inappropriate e-waste recycling practices. Findings The amount of e-waste being generated is increasing rapidly and is compounded by both illegal exportation and inappropriate donation of electronic equipment, especially computers, from developed to developing countries. As little as 25\% of e-waste is recycled in formal recycling centers with adequate worker protection. The health consequences of both direct exposures during recycling and indirect exposures through environmental contamination are potentially severe but poorly studied. Policy frameworks aimed at protecting vulnerable populations exist but are not effectively applied. Conclusions E-waste recycling is necessary but it should be conducted in a safe and standardized manor. The acceptable risk thresholds for hazardous, secondary e-waste substances should not be different for developing and developed countries. However, the acceptable thresholds should be different for children and adults given the physical differences and pronounced vulnerabilities of children. Improving occupational conditions for all e-waste workers and striving for the eradication of child labor is non-negotiable.},

  abstract = {Food waste has important environmental, social and economic impacts and increasing attention has been given lately to the unparalleled scale of food waste in the food supply chain worldwide. An initiative aiming to reduce food waste was tested at the School of Agriculture canteen (University of Lisbon, Portugal). The ``Clean dish, clean conscience!'' initiative consisted of a simple and inexpensive education campaign to raise awareness of reducing plate waste, by establishing the connection between food waste and personal behaviour. As a first stage plate waste from canteen users was measured over a 10\,day period. After this period, a waste consumption index and per capita waste consumption were calculated to evaluate the level of satisfaction of the consumer and the related concern about food wastage, and was classified as Bad. After this first stage it was concluded that the users did not have strong convictions about avoiding food waste. During the second stage of the project an education campaign was implemented with plate waste being monitored for a further 16\,days to assess the effectiveness of the campaign. The approach consisted of displaying simple and affordable informative posters in strategic areas of the canteen with simple messages reminding not to accept food they knew they would not eat. This led to a mean reduction in the waste consumption index of {$\sim$}15\%. A parallel action encouraging separation of organic and inorganic waste was implemented as well, with an active participation of {$>$}70\% of the users. The initiative achieved its objective of reducing plate waste by raising awareness of the daily food waste problem at the institution's canteen and by suggesting ``how-to'' actions for reducing such waste. This study showed how avoidable waste can be reduced simply by making students aware of the topic of food waste. Simple strategies may be useful to improve behaviours and increase sustainability of the canteens at Universities although this proved to be only efficient with the collaboration of the canteen staff that needs solid education. From the results, a set of measures was presented to the University Social Services for adoption to ensure a permanent reduction of food waste and recyclables in the University canteens.},

Here, we report on a field experiment that was conducted at twelve university and business sites to examine whether the use of reusable cups can be promoted through easily implementable measures. The study found that both environmental messaging and the provision of alternatives increased the use of reusable cups. While a charge on disposable cups increased their use as well, a discount on reusable cups did not. The effects for the individual measures were modest, but additive, meaning that the greatest behavioural change was achieved with a combination of measures. None of the measures negatively impacted the total number of hot drink sales. One university continued with the charge after the experiment had finished and distributed more reusable cups for free among their students. This boosted the use of reusable cups up to 33.7\% across three caf{\'e}s. This shows that a charge in combination with the provision of alternatives can increase the use of reusable cups substantially in the long term.},

The purpose of the present study is twofold: to investigate factors important for explaining the recycling behavior of young people and to explore respondents' own ideas regarding barriers to recycling. This paper reports on a survey conducted from 2020 to 2021 among residents of student housing in Stockholm, Sweden. Eight hypotheses were formulated based on earlier research and a model was constructed. Answers from 1202 respondents were first analyzed by logistic regression to test factors affecting respondents' self-reported recycling of paper, plastic, glass, and metal. Results show that the full model containing all predictors was statistically significant. The results showed that only four of the hypotheses were confirmed. Positive attitude toward recycling, personal norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived convenience of recycling are positively affecting recycling behavior. In addition, 673 open answers were analyzed to provide information on unforeseen factors of importance for recycling behavior. This study adds to research by testing factors affecting recycling behaviors in a national context and by identifying new possible factors of importance. The results are also of benefit to business practitioners within the construction sector or within facility management in identifying activities that would add to sustainable development.},

  abstract = {Electronic waste, or e-waste, is the fastest growing category of waste in developed countries and a threat to the environment and human health. The extension of electronic products life cycles could reduce the use of finite resources, the emission of pollutants, and the amount of waste disposed of in the landfills, delaying the impacts of disposal and product replacement. Consumers' decisions affect the environmental impact of a product since deliberate consumer effort is necessary to extend and fully explore the potential life cycle of a product. The objective of this article is to investigate current consumer practices in the repair of electronic products. To achieve this goal, we analyze recently published research presenting surveys and case studies about the repair of electronic products. The literature review identified a range of barriers and motivations that influence the decision to repair. We also examined how institutional initiatives to address product reparability, such as governmental directives, are responding to consumer practices. Our results emphasize the need for an environment that promotes and enables more sustainable behaviors. We discuss the necessity to consider not only technical aspects but also intangible aspects in public perception, such as the role of perceived obsolescence in the search for a more circular economy.},

  abstract = {Although the paperless office (PLO) management system has been established with the goal of paper usage reduction, demand for paper has still showed an uptrend over the years. Given the substantial pressure on forest ecosystems due to a continued increase of paper consumption, understanding the behavioral aspects of paper consumption is, therefore, required. This present paper aims at exploring the factors underlying paper consumption behavior. Empirical data was acquired through a survey of 266 Indonesian students, involving both undergraduate and postgraduate students. A theoretical model, based on the Comprehensive Action Determination Model (CADM), was tested against the empirical data. It was found that the model received reasonable support from the data. Results indicate that reducing paper consumption behavior is strongly influenced by habit and, marginally significant, by intention. Furthermore, habit formation is influenced by both normative processes and situational influences. The results, to some extent, explain the PLO paradox in a way that the PLO program should have focused on breaking the habit of paper usage instead of promoting the benefits of PLO. Introducing a paper quota and rationing (fee) to new students, as the main target, is a potential policy intervention implied from the results.},

  abstract = {We present results from the FAOSTAT emissions shares database, covering emissions from agri-food systems and their shares to total anthropogenic emissions for 196 countries and 40 territories for the period 1990--2019. We find that in 2019, global agri-food system emissions were 16.5 (95 \%; CI range: 11--22) billion metric tonnes (Gt CO2 eq. yr-1), corresponding to 31 \% (range: 19 \%--43 \%) of total anthropogenic emissions. Of the agri-food system total, global emissions within the farm gate -- from crop and livestock production processes including on-farm energy use -- were 7.2 Gt CO2 eq. yr-1; emissions from land use change, due to deforestation and peatland degradation, were 3.5 Gt CO2 eq. yr-1; and emissions from pre- and post-production processes -- manufacturing of fertilizers, food processing, packaging, transport, retail, household consumption and food waste disposal -- were 5.8 Gt CO2 eq. yr-1. Over the study period 1990--2019, agri-food system emissions increased in total by 17 \%, largely driven by a doubling of emissions from pre- and post-production processes. Conversely, the FAOSTAT data show that since 1990 land use emissions decreased by 25 \%, while emissions within the farm gate increased 9 \%. In 2019, in terms of individual greenhouse gases (GHGs), pre- and post-production processes emitted the most CO2 (3.9 Gt CO2 yr-1), preceding land use change (3.3 Gt CO2 yr-1) and farm gate (1.2 Gt CO2 yr-1) emissions. Conversely, farm gate activities were by far the major emitter of methane (140 Mt CH4 yr-1) and of nitrous oxide (7.8 Mt N2O yr-1). Pre- and post-production processes were also significant emitters of methane (49 Mt CH4 yr-1), mostly generated from the decay of solid food waste in landfills and open dumps. One key trend over the 30-year period since 1990 highlighted by our analysis is the increasingly important role of food-related emissions generated outside of agricultural land, in pre- and post-production processes along the agri-food system, at global, regional and national scales. In fact, our data show that by 2019, pre- and post-production processes had overtaken farm gate processes to become the largest GHG component of agri-food system emissions in Annex I parties (2.2 Gt CO2 eq. yr-1). They also more than doubled in non-Annex I parties (to 3.5 Gt CO2 eq. yr-1), becoming larger than emissions from land use change. By 2019 food supply chains had become the largest agri-food system component in China (1100 Mt CO2 eq. yr-1), the USA (700 Mt CO2 eq. yr-1) and the EU-27 (600 Mt CO2 eq. yr-1). This has important repercussions for food-relevant national mitigation strategies, considering that until recently these have focused mainly on reductions of non-CO2 gases within the farm gate and on CO2 mitigation from land use change.

  abstract = {Purpose -- This study investigates the recycling attitudes and behaviour of university students and staff members, and suggests ways to improve environmental policies and recycling facilities in a university campus. Design/methodology/approach -- This study applies the theory of planned behaviour, through which it develops an instrument to measure the determinants of recycling behaviour among the people in a university campus. A survey was designed and administered at a public university in Hong Kong; 205 valid responses from 179 students and 26 staff members were collected. A partial least squares approach was used to validate the proposed model. This model accounted for the 42.1 per cent and 50.3 per cent variance (R2) in behavioural intention and behaviour, respectively, vis-{\`a}-vis recycling activities. Findings -- The survey results suggested that behavioural intention with regard to recycling is influenced by attitude, the subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, awareness of consequences, the moral norms, and convenience. Educational and promotional programmes highlighting the benefits and importance of recycling activities and convenience of the recycling facilities can be adopted as the key strategies to encourage recycling on campus. Research limitations/implications -- The unique culture in relation to recycling in the specific campus environment and the nature of the sample might limit the generalisability of the results to other areas and contexts. The self-report-based measures adopted in this study might lead to a social desirability bias in the results provided by the respondents. Originality/value -- The findings provide insightful information for universities and the wider community to shape a more user-friendly and convenient recycling scheme. This can fulfil the actors' social responsibility.},

  abstract = {Purpose To explore the effects of ``soft'' behavioral intervention policies (eg, green emotions, social norms) and ``soft'' economic incentive policies (eg, high-intensity subsidies, low-intensity subsidies) and their combinations on the public's green product purchasing behavior. Participants and Methods An online questionnaire experiment was conducted on Chinese users using Credamo online questionnaire platform to explore the effects of different ``soft'' intervention policies on consumers' green purchasing behavior, and the sample data were examined using multiple regression. In Study 1, a total of 460 valid samples were collected to explore the differences in the effects of single intervention policies; in Study 2, a total of 556 valid samples were collected to explore the effects of a combination of soft policies. Results In the area of green product purchasing, both behavioral interventions and economic incentives alone can promote green consumption behavior; economic incentives have a more positive impact on guiding consumers to green consumption; the combination of ``soft'' behavioral interventions and ``soft'' economic incentives has a positive impact on green consumption. The combination of ``soft'' behavioral intervention policies and ``soft'' economic incentive policies is more effective than the individual policies. Conclusion The experimental results of Study 1 show that the policy effects of both behavioral intervention policies and economic incentive intervention policies are evident for goods with different value attributes. Meanwhile, comparing the two types of soft intervention policies, we find that the effect of economic incentive intervention policies is stronger than that of soft behavioral intervention policies. In Study 2, the empirical analysis of the policy mix shows that the policy mix is more effective. The combination of ``soft'' economic incentive policies and ``soft'' behavioral intervention policies can effectively increase the salience of policy instruments, and the effect of policy combinations is greater than that of single policies.},

  abstract = {Background Sustainability and going green have become popular trends among foodservice organizations. Despite this interest, foodservice operations still produce large amounts of edible food waste and contribute significantly to waste management problems. Objective The purpose of this operational study was to determine how to introduce food waste behavior change into a dining facility using a simple message-type intervention that requires little sustained administrative support and can provide optimum effect. Design The population for this study was 540 university students living in residence halls and participating in a meal plan. This study assessed whether simple prompt-type message interventions had an influence or if the addition of more personally relevant feedback-based data elicited greater change in student beliefs and food waste behaviors. A written questionnaire and individual student tray waste tracking were used to gather data. Simple print-format messages were evaluated, allowing the effect of an affordable message campaign to be determined. Results Students had a higher-than-neutral level of belief, but did not indicate a strong conviction toward environmental sustainability or food waste. The edible food items disposed of on 19,046 trays in this all-you-care-to-eat university dining operation were evaluated. On average, more than 57 g edible food was disposed of per tray, accumulating to {$>$}1.5 tons of food waste during the 6-week study. The simple to-the-point prompt-type message stimulated a 15\% reduction in food waste. The addition of a more personalized feedback-based message did not stimulate an additional change beyond that of the prompt message. Conclusions These findings indicate that simply making university students aware of the topic of food waste may be useful in improving their behaviors and the sustainability of the foodservice facility.},

  abstract = {Second-hand consumption has been quietly undergoing a makeover in recent years. As part of this shift, the concept of shopping for second-hand goods has been redefined. In today's retail marketplace, a mix of thrift stores, high-end stores, and online retailers are recognising the value of second-hand and hosting flea markets or launching their own vintage product collections. However, limited research attention has been paid to role of `fashionability' as a motivation for consumers to shop for second-hand goods. In this study, we explore modern consumer second-hand shopping behaviour and motivations, inclusive of fashionability. Through a segmentation of second-hand store shoppers, we identify four distinct segments. While we find a polarisation of fashionability motivations, the vast majority (83\%) of second-hand shoppers are driven by fashion when shopping in second-hand stores. The findings present several implications for second-hand retailers, including new ways to expand their customer base by tapping into elements of fashionability.}
